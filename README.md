### A Javascript library for storing models to HTML 5 local storage with parent-child view control ###

This repository contains a javascript library for writing complete HTML5-based data entry applications. 

The library supports:  

* Persisting javascript models automatically to HTML5 local storage. Models can include parent-child (e.g. master-detail) relationships. 
* Controlling parent-child data management (CRUD) HTML views.

Writing data entry applications consists of writing:

1. Data models in javascript.
2. Correspcorresponding HTML views for adding, deleting, and editing the models that abide by field name and controller [conventions][http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration).
 

For example, to write a shipment data entry application that records Shipment information and child Delivery details, two models relating parent to child are written for Shipment and Delivery, respectively. Then, corresponding HTML views for adding, deleting, and editing Shipments and Deliveries are then written in conformance to field name and library naming conventions.
